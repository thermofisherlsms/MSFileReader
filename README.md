# MSFileReader

MSFileReader is a COM based library for accessing the RAW files generated on our mass spectrometry instruments.

MSFileReader can be downloaded from our Software Download site (https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/login?nextURL=%2Fcontrol%2Fthmo%2Fhome)

MSFileReader is still available for customer use but we have replaced it with our newer, .Net based RawFileReader product.
