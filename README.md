# MSFileReader

MSFileReader is a COM based library for accessing the RAW files generated on our mass spectrometry instruments.

While the latest version of the installer for MSFileReader can be found on this site, older versions of MSFileReader
can be downloaded from our Software Download site (https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/login?nextURL=%2Fcontrol%2Fthmo%2Fhome)

MSFileReader is still available for customer use but we have replaced it with our newer, .Net based RawFileReader product.
